✅ Use Cases in Automation Testing (especially with Selenium + TestNG/Cucumber)

1. Final Variables – Define Constants

You often use final variables to store reusable constants like URLs, locators, file paths, etc.

🔧 Why helpful?

Prevents accidental modification of critical values.


2. Final Methods – Protect Core Utility Logic

You can use final for common utility/helper methods (e.g., reading Excel, logging) to avoid overriding and altering stable implementations.

🔧 Why helpful?

Prevents framework-level utility functions from being overridden and breaking behavior.

3. Final Classes – Framework Core Components

Mark  classes like  Hooks as final if you don't want them to be extended.

🔧 Where super helps in Automation (with examples)

1. Calling a Parent Method
Useful when child class overrides a method, but still needs to reuse parent logic.

🔍 Why it's helpful?

Allows extending or enhancing base functionality instead of rewriting it.

2. Accessing Shadowed Variables

If a child class defines a variable with the same name as the parent, super helps access the parent's version.
